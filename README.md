# About The Project
This project was created as part of my learning process with Postman. It includes various REST API requests to interact with the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs).

# Implemented Postman Tests
- Ensures API returns correct HTTP status codes
- Ensures API responses are returned within an acceptable time
- Ensures API responses are returned in JSON format
- Validates the structure of the returned JSON
- Checks for missing data fields
- Ensures API correctly limits and skips results based on query parameters
- Ensures API returns proper error messages when invalid data is submitted
- Tests for handling missing parameters and incorrect data types
- Checks if POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests modify resources correctly
